== About me
I am currently a visiting PhD student (under the supervision of [https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02301 Prof. François Gay-Balmaz]) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore.  I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2021 (Supervisor: [https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jgml/jsyxtkxx/sdh/index.htm Prof. Donghua Shi]). Now I am also a PhD student (Supervisor: [https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/mechanics/10519.html Prof. Jinzhi Wang]) majored in Mechanics and Control at Peking University (PKU). \n

Please feel free to drop me an email for discussions about any interestnig research topics on *Geometry*, *Mechanics*, and *Control*!




== Research Interest
My research interest lies at geometric modeling and simulation of dynamical systems, which includes the following topics:\n
- *Geometric Mechanics* (Stochastic & Nonholonomic)\n
- *Estimation and Filtering* (Robot Systems & Flexible Systems)\n
- *Geometric Numerical Integration* (Variational Integrators)\n
- *Geometry of Gaussian Distributions* (Controlling Uncertainties)\n
- *Computationally Efficient Physics-Informed Learning*\n
