== About me
Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics, Peking University (Advisor: [https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/mechanics/10519.html Prof. Jinzhi Wang]). Also, I am currently a visiting PhD student (Advisor: [https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02301 Prof. François Gay-Balmaz]) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore.  Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2021 (Advisor: [https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jgml/jsyxtkxx/sdh/index.htm Prof. Donghua Shi]).\n




== Research Interest
My research interest lies at geometric modeling and simulation of dynamical systems, which includes the following topics:\n
- *Geometric Mechanics & Control* (especially Stochastic & Nonholonomic)\n
- *Geometric Numerical Integration* (Variational Integrators)\n
- *Geometric Estimation and Filtering* (for Robot Systems & Flexible Systems)\n
- *Physics-Informed Learning on Manifolds*\n

[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-03921-7_21 \[Paper Link\]]\n

We derive stochastic variational principles for stochastic unconstrained and stochastic nonholonomically constrained systems. An interesting example of the stochastic rolling disk is given to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach.
